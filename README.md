## Safety Warning
Never use widgets made by people you don't trust! Even though I have tried my best to remove all possibilities for a widget to affect your computer in dangerous ways, they could still contain malicious scripts and it's best to play it safe than to potentially use a malicious widget and risk the safety of your computer.
